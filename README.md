# MassImageRenamer
 
As the name suggest this is a Program that helps you to rename a lot of images relatively fast.

The focus of project was to create something as fast as possible, [as I wanted to help a random redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmer/comments/xkdkn9/iso_software_or_a_programmer/).

Therefore if you encounter any error, please create an issue.

You can download the installer with all dependencies form [here](https://github.com/FelixLeander/ProgramsForInternetPeople/tree/main/bin/Release), just run setup.exe and your good to go.
